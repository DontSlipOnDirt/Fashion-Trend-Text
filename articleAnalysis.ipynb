Energised by the city’s vibrant spirit, he returned to Florence to open a travel goods store, with the aspiration to narrate, through his luggage, a new way of living.', 'More than a century later, the notion of London as a place of cultural convergence still holds true, as do its parallels with the House’s constant process of self-discovery, forever calling on archival elements that anchor its heritage-inspired narrative.', 'Sabato De Sarno, Gucci’s Creative Director, also shares a history with London. “We choose London for the Cruise show, knowing that was the right choice. I owe a lot to this city, it has welcomed and listened to me.\" Tate Modern – a place where art, design, and fashion intertwine - are connected both in heritage and spirit. “To explore a creative direction is to bring yourself into an already-existing space and show it through your eyes, working from room to room with the goal of reshaping the building again,” De Sarno said in a statement.', 'The same is true for Gucci, whose founder was inspired by his experience there. The House’s return is driven by a desire to be immersed in its distinctive essence, its creative driving force with its limitless capability to put together contrasts, make them converse, and find ways to coexist. \"Today we are here to celebrate that spirit. Tate Modern is the perfect cross-section to narrate the city’s essence, with its great Turbine Hall that welcomes and gathers everyone, and with the Tanks, generators of ideas.”', 'While this was De Sarno’s first Cruise presentation, it marks his third collection in eight months since his appointment at the Florentine fashion house. Many were hoping his vision for the storied Maison would come together with this show. With Kering in the midst of revenue woes, and not just from its star brand, falling share prices, drops in sales and a challenging first quarter in 2024 were seen across the group’s portfolio. Can a single designer fix all the ills? Is it even fair to hold him to those expectations?', 'De Sarno has an egalitarian hand that so far has executed perfectly nice clothes and bags. True, they may have not stirred the soul the way John Galliano’s couture presentation brought emotion, or even moved the trend needle off the scales, like Bottega Veneta did when it introduced its giant woven accessories. But they have certainly not brought any offense.', 'The brown suede and leather outerwear in the new Gucci Rosso were testament that real clothes are back; the need for eccentric styling and unnecessary fluff is no longer what customers are after. Even the aspirational luxury shopper, who often likes a logo and recognizable fashion, is less inclined to buy into hype-led trends.', 'A sense of bohemia filtered through the collection, with fewer micro shorts and a more relaxed look including roomy denims, oversized blousons paired with culottes, a chiffon bra under a cotton blouse. With tousled long hair, the looks were less slick than they were relaxed and tomboyish, the way Londoners embrace street style, subcultures, and mix high and low fashion.', 'De Sarno did right to present Cruise in London; borrowing the city’s dynamic landscape showed a willingness to experiment and embrace its vibrancy.\\nThis collection may not come to define the zeitgeist, but it has pieces for a wide audience, if only they care to shop at Gucci.']}, {'title': 'Probe reveals persistent labour issues at Shein, despite promises of improvement', 'content': [\"Despite Shein's public assurances to improve working conditions in its supplier factories following the exposure of poor labour practices over two years ago, a recent follow-up investigation reveals that 75-hour work weeks remain commonplace in southern China.\", \"Data from Swiss-based watchdog Public Eye, who interviewed employees in Guangzhou, where Shein manufactures many of its products, highlight the stark contradiction between the brand's sustainability rhetoric and the harsh reality faced by workers.

I owe a lot to this city, it has welcomed and listened to me.\" Tate Modern – a place where art, design, and fashion intertwine - are connected both in heritage and spirit. “To explore a creative direction is to bring yourself into an already-existing space and show it through your eyes, working from room to room with the goal of reshaping the building again,” De Sarno said in a statement.',\n",
       " 'The same is true for Gucci, whose founder was inspired by his experience there. The House’s return is driven by a desire to be immersed in its distinctive essence, its creative driving force with its limitless capability to put together contrasts, make them converse, and find ways to coexist. \"Today we are here to celebrate that spirit. Tate Modern is the perfect cross-section to narrate the city’s essence, with its great Turbine Hall that welcomes and gathers everyone, and with the Tanks, generators of ideas.”',\n",
       " 'While this was De Sarno’s first Cruise presentation, it marks his third collection in eight months since his appointment at the Florentine fashion house.

With Kering in the midst of revenue woes, and not just from its star brand, falling share prices, drops in sales and a challenging first quarter in 2024 were seen across the group’s portfolio. Can a single designer fix all the ills? Is it even fair to hold him to those expectations?',\n",
       " 'De Sarno has an egalitarian hand that so far has executed perfectly nice clothes and bags.

      "As the peak of summer approaches, the way we dress evolves into a thoughtful blend of functionality and style. High summer, with its promise of blazing sunshine and longer daylight hours, demands clothing that is both fashionable and practical, requiring a nuanced approach to fabric selection and design. FashionUnited has examined the key strategies for curating a high summer wardrobe, focusing on comfort, style, and the innovative designs from Cup of Joe, a denim brand that seamlessly blends classic and contemporary fashion with a strategic   approach. By ensuring the continuous availability of key summer staples and beloved classics, this inventory management strategy enables brands to optimise resource use and prolong the lifecycles of their products, all while keeping summer fashion fresh and accessible. Fashion buyers and retailers increasingly turn to NOS products. This strategy offers significant advantages over traditional purchasing methods, which often require buying inventory one year in advance. NOS products allow retailers to respond more flexibly and efficiently to real-time market trends and consumer preferences, ensuring that shelves are stocked with in-demand items that cater to current fashion trends. This not only reduces the risk of overstocking outdated styles but also maximises sales potential by continually offering customers the latest in summer fashion. By maintaining a steady supply of essential and popular items, retailers can better manage their inventory, improve turnover rates, and meet consumer expectations with precision, making the NOS approach particularly attractive during the unpredictable high summer season. In high summer, the choice of silhouette is crucial and can make the difference between comfort and discomfort. Clothing that allows air to circulate without clinging to the body is key. Consider layered dresses, loose-fitting t-shirts, and shorts—garments that offer movement and breathability while remaining fashionable. These styles are not only comfortable; they also align with the summer vibe, making them perfect for both casual and formal occasions. The relaxed yet stylish nature of these garments is reflected in Cup of Joe's SS24 collection, including the 'Tracy Boyfriend Shorts' and 'Zoe Cropped Tanktop', which combine breezy comfort with casual chic appeal suitable for any high summer event. Color plays a crucial role in summer wear. Light hues such as whites, pastels, and soft neutrals reflect the sun's rays more effectively than darker, absorbing shades, helping to keep the body cool during the peak of heat. This palette also harmonises with the season's aesthetic, promoting a sense of freshness and vibrancy. Cup of Joe captures this essence beautifully in their summer collection, particularly with the 'Emma Shorts', available in light blue and white—perfect for mixing and matching with other summer staples. The fabric of your summer clothing should always possess breathable properties. Materials that wick away moisture and allow the skin to breathe, such as cotton, linen, and bamboo, are ideal. These textiles are not only easy to care for but also environmentally friendly and durable, making them a wise choice for the environmentally conscious. Cup of Joe's commitment to comfort and sustainability is evident in their choice of fabrics for the SS24 collection, which features predominantly cotton-based garments such as the 'Olivia Regular Tanktop' for women and the 'Finn Regular Round Neck T-Shirt' for men, designed to ensure maximum ventilation and comfort. Cup of Joe, known for their minimalist yet trendy approach, offers an SS24 collection that embodies the spirit of summer with a focus on comfort and simplicity. For women, the selection includes a variety of shorts like the 'Emma Shorts' and 'Tracy Boyfriend Shorts', available in shades that reflect the summer palette, alongside tank tops such as the 'Liv Halter Neck Tanktop' and 'Olivia Regular Tanktop', which provide comfort with a hint of stretch. Notably, these items are part of the brand's 'Never Out of Stock' (NOS) strategy, ensuring they are readily available during peak season when demand is high. Men are not left out, with options like the 'Finn Regular Round Neck T-Shirt' available in essential summer hues, ensuring a classic and comfortable fit. Each piece is crafted with attention to detail, focusing on breathable materials and colours that stay vibrant under the sun. Made entirely from cotton, these T-shirts provide the ideal combination of style and comfort, essential for any summer wardrobe. Dressing for high summer involves more than just choosing the right garments; it's about creating a harmonious blend of style, comfort, and functionality. Cup of Joe’s SS24 collection exemplifies this approach with carefully designed pieces that cater to both aesthetic appeal and practical needs, backed by their strategic NOS policy. By selecting the right silhouettes, colours, and fabrics, you can enjoy the summer months in style and comfort, making every outfit a testament to thoughtful fashion. This NOS appeal allows fashion buyers and retailers to adapt quickly to changing trends and consumer preferences, enhancing the overall retail experience and ensuring customer satisfaction. Buckingham Palace has confirmed PETA's long-awaited request: Queen Camilla has pledged to no long procure fur for her wardrobe, following the precedent set by the late Queen Elizabeth II in 2019. This marks Queen Camilla's inaugural stance against the fur industry, however the confirmation does not state she will not wear fur from existing pieces in the current royal wardrobes. In response to Queen Camilla's decision, PETA founder Ingrid Newkirk stated: “PETA is toasting to Queen Camilla with a glass of the finest claret for being a true queen by standing with the 95 percent of British people who also refuse to wear animal fur, as polls show. It’s right and proper for the monarchy to reflect British values by recognising that fur has no place in our society – and it makes the Ministry of Defence’s use of real bear fur for the royal guard’s caps ever more preposterous and out of touch.” PETA's ongoing campaign to abolish the Ministry of Defence's use of bearskin for the King's Guard's caps spans two decades, with a recent exposé shedding light on the brutal practices employed in sourcing bear fur. PETA said the disturbing footage unveils the grim reality faced by bears in Canada, where they are lured with bait, shot, and gruesomely mutilated to procure their fur, potentially destined for use in ceremonial headgear like that used by the royal family.

The association with the Royal Family can significantly increase awareness, both domestically and internationally, with the aim to attract new customers who are drawn to the allure of royal endorsement. Gucci and London share a long history, with founder Guccio Gucci finding work as a porter in the Savoy Hotel in 1897. Energised by the city’s vibrant spirit, he returned to Florence to open a travel goods store, with the aspiration to narrate, through his luggage, a new way of living. More than a century later, the notion of London as a place of cultural convergence still holds true, as do its parallels with the House’s constant process of self-discovery, forever calling on archival elements that anchor its heritage-inspired narrative. Sabato De Sarno, Gucci’s Creative Director, also shares a history with London. “We choose London for the Cruise show, knowing that was the right choice. I owe a lot to this city, it has welcomed and listened to me.\" Tate Modern – a place where art, design, and fashion intertwine - are connected both in heritage and spirit. “To explore a creative direction is to bring yourself into an already-existing space and show it through your eyes, working from room to room with the goal of reshaping the building again,” De Sarno said in a statement. The same is true for Gucci, whose founder was inspired by his experience there. The House’s return is driven by a desire to be immersed in its distinctive essence, its creative driving force with its limitless capability to put together contrasts, make them converse, and find ways to coexist. \"Today we are here to celebrate that spirit. Tate Modern is the perfect cross-section to narrate the city’s essence, with its great Turbine Hall that welcomes and gathers everyone, and with the Tanks, generators of ideas.” While this was De Sarno’s first Cruise presentation, it marks his third collection in eight months since his appointment at the Florentine fashion house. Many were hoping his vision for the storied Maison would come together with this show. With Kering in the midst of revenue woes, and not just from its star brand, falling share prices, drops in sales and a challenging first quarter in 2024 were seen across the group’s portfolio. Can a single designer fix all the ills? Is it even fair to hold him to those expectations? De Sarno has an egalitarian hand that so far has executed perfectly nice clothes and bags. True, they may have not stirred the soul the way John Galliano’s couture presentation brought emotion, or even moved the trend needle off the scales, like Bottega Veneta did when it introduced its giant woven accessories. But they have certainly not brought any offense. The brown suede and leather outerwear in the new Gucci Rosso were testament that real clothes are back; the need for eccentric styling and unnecessary fluff is no longer what customers are after. Even the aspirational luxury shopper, who often likes a logo and recognizable fashion, is less inclined to buy into hype-led trends. A sense of bohemia filtered through the collection, with fewer micro shorts and a more relaxed look including roomy denims, oversized blousons paired with culottes, a chiffon bra under a cotton blouse. With tousled long hair, the looks were less slick than they were relaxed and tomboyish, the way Londoners embrace street style, subcultures, and mix high and low fashion. De Sarno did right to present Cruise in London; borrowing the city’s dynamic landscape showed a willingness to experiment and embrace its vibrancy.\n",
      "This collection may not come to define the zeitgeist, but it has pieces for a wide audience, if only they care to shop at Gucci. Despite Shein's public assurances to improve working conditions in its supplier factories following the exposure of poor labour practices over two years ago, a recent follow-up investigation reveals that 75-hour work weeks remain commonplace in southern China. Data from Swiss-based watchdog Public Eye, who interviewed employees in Guangzhou, where Shein manufactures many of its products, highlight the stark contradiction between the brand's sustainability rhetoric and the harsh reality faced by workers. The persistent overtime, often exceeding legal limits and the company's own code of conduct, underscores ongoing challenges within the ultra-fast fashion industry. Since the initial scandal, Shein has invested heavily in reputation management, including reports of factory audits aimed at ensuring fair wages for workers. However, Public Eye’s report shows discrepancies have emerged regarding the validity of these audits, with quotes disappearing from Shein's website and conflicting statements from auditing firms. Furthermore, the intricate network of companies within Shein's organizational structure, coupled with opaque financial operations and the departure of its founder from the board, raise concerns about transparency and corporate governance, particularly in light of the company's planned IPO. The lack of transparency and ongoing labour issues within Shein's supply chain pose challenges not only for potential investors but also for policymakers seeking to regulate the fast fashion industry. While some parliamentary initiatives aim to address these issues, effective regulation remains a distant goal. For more information visit www.publiceye.ch. Online marketplace Ebay, which has been placing itself at the forefront of the recommerce clothing market, has unveiled a new ‘click-to-resell’ feature that will make it easier for sellers to list their pre-loved clothing with just “a few clicks of a button”. The new ‘resell on Ebay’ feature has been designed to transform the way consumers can resell their pre-loved fashion items and deliver brands a new way to encourage circularity of products. Charis Marquez, global general manager of fashion at Ebay, said in a statement: “Ebay is focused on delivering solutions to brands while curating an elevated marketplace for buyers and sellers. “Reducing friction and removing barriers to brands and consumers engaging in recommerce is crucial to fostering a pre-loved fashion marketplace. Our new resell feature helps brands keep their product out of landfill, while giving consumers an incredibly easy way to give their item a second life.” The new resell feature will be built into a Certilogo’s Secure by Design digital ID, accessible by scanning a connected product’s smart label. The system offers a simple and streamlined process, as when a user scans the QR code via the product’s smart label, a ‘resell on eBay’ button is displayed in the digital brand experience. Once a user clicks on the button, they will be directed to check the authenticity of the item through Certilogo’s AI-based authentication system by signing in with their Ebay account. When the authentication process is complete, an Ebay listing will be pre-filled with information from the brand about the item.  in 2023 to boost pre-owned authentication through secure-by-design digital authentication technology, an AI-powered digital ID printed on the actual product tag. Michele Casucci, chief executive and founder of Certilogo, added: “This new ‘resell on Ebay’ feature was a natural next step for Certilogo’s innovation and product evolution. “With 540 million products already connected by our secure digital IDs, our mission is to empower brands by helping them create an experience that blends the physical with the digital world. Being able to securely resell your products with ease only makes the circular shopping experience more accessible for everyone.” Italian outerwear brand Save The Duck will be the first brand to pilot the new feature, with their connected garments featuring the new resell button rolling out from May. Ebay adds that it plans to expand the service to other brands using the Certilogo Digital ID in the near future. On utilising the scheme, Nicolas Bargi, chief executive and founder at Save The Duck, said: “Finding solutions that help our customers make more circular choices – and keep our product out of landfill – is of the utmost importance to us. “To be the first brand to use this new eBay and Certilogo technology reinforces our commitment to ensuring maximum transparency to our community.” The resell feature is among several advances Ebay has made to improve the selling and buying experience. Last year, the company launched a customised listing flow tailored for sneakers and introduced its magical listing tool, which uses  , allowing sellers to list items with ease, and buyers can access more information about potential purchases. In the UK, Ebay has also   and launched its   hosted by comedian Katherine Ryan and the retailer's pre-loved style director Amy Bannerman.
